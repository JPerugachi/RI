Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup flour into the oil. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula to release solids into the gravy. step 9: Stir in milk, increase the heat to medium, and bring the gravy to a simmer.

How to Make Chicken Milanese \\\\u201cItalian chicken cutlets are the O.G. quick and easy dinner that everyone needs to know how to make,\\\\u201d according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a.

No other method I've come across has the same combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and plate-scratching crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!\\\", \\\"1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered | 0.5 yellow onion, grated | 4 cloves garlic, minced | 1 teaspoon fine salt | 0.5 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper | 4 cups oil for frying, or as needed | 0.75 cup cornstarch | 0.5 cup self-rising flour | 1 teaspoon white sugar | 0.5 teaspoon ground black pepper | 0.25 teaspoon salt | 1 cup very cold water, or as needed\\\", \\\"step 1: Gather all ingredients. step 2: Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight. step 3: Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C). step 4: While oil is heating, make the batter: Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade. step 5: Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack. step 6: Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). step 7: Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain. step 8: Enjoy!\\\", \\\"4 hrs 30 mins\\\", \\\"4\\\", \\\"4.8\\\", \\\"Calories: 472 | Fat: 24g | Carbs: 44g | Protein: 19g\\\", \\\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/r5zhVQDa55-8JF6F-Z6c4dd1uyM=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chef-john-c50f1c2cb23f4e7786d66c30bddf8bcb.jpg\\\"], [\\\"Chicken Arroz Caldo (Chicken Rice Porridge)\\\", \\\"Arroz caldo is a comforting and flavorsome Filipino rice and chicken soup served mainly as a snack but can be enjoyed any time of the day.\\\", \\\"2 tablespoons olive oil | 1  onion, diced | 2 cloves garlic, crushed | 1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced | 2 0.25 pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded | 1 tablespoon fish sauce (Optional) | 5 0.25 cups chicken broth | 1 cup glutinous sweet rice | salt and pepper to taste | 1  green onion, chopped | 1  lemon, sliced (Optional) | 1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired (Optional)\\\", \\\"step 1: Gather all ingredients. step 2: Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.
